# Just a little information

---

-   Tested using Python 3.7.6
-   No external library used
-   Gets around 99% accuracy on the bank note dataset
-   Run `nn.py` for AND gate example, and `cli.py` for Bank Note Authentication example
-   `nn.py` contains the perceptron class, whereas `cli.py` prepares the bank note data, splits it into `test` and `train` parts, trains the perceptron, and prints the accuracy.
